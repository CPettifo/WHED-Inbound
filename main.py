# The goal of this script is to allow for the analysis of structured HEI data to allow for insertion into the 
# World Higher Education Database, the first iteration uses CRICOS but given time I plan to modify this to take
# any structured data as input
#TODO move this into a README

# there should be three spreadsheets in your workbook, in the repository is a template with example source information
# ext_inst is a list of the institutions from the recognised government or credential recognition body
# It should have the following columns in this order: row index, institution ID, institution name, institution alternative name, institution homepage,
# a concatenation of the institutional address
# 
# ext_cred is a list of the credentials offered 
# It should have the following columns in this order: institution ID, institution name, whether credential is not expired (manually set this to "No" if it is not present in extraction)
# Credential level (i.e. Bachelors, Masters, or NQF level), Course Name, Course Code, FOS Levels if available and in descending order of hierarchy

# I'm not planning for this to be particularly well optimised, as it is a script that will only be run periodically, and likely on local systems in the background.
